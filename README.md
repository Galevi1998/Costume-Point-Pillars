# Custom PointPillars: Modified 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds

This repository is a **customized and modified version** of the original [PointPillars implementation by zhulf0804](https://github.com/zhulf0804/PointPillars), focused on fine-tuning and adapting the model for different performance goals and dataset variations.

## ðŸ”„ What's Different in This Version

- Modified model architecture and training configuration
- Different data augmentation techniques
- Adjusted evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Different results compared to the original implementation (see below)

> ðŸ“Œ **Note**: This code is **not officially maintained** by the original authors. It is a derivative work maintained by **[@Galevi1998](https://github.com/Galevi1998)**.

## ðŸ“Š My Results

Compared to the original repo, this implementation yielded **different performance** metrics on the KITTI validation set due to changes in training, preprocessing, and possibly hardware.

(Add your own mAP or results table here if you'd like.)
